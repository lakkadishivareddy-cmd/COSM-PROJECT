## 📌 Project Overview

This study investigates the relationship between height and weight using statistical analysis and predictive modelling. Key tasks include:

- Loading and exploring the dataset  
- Visualizing Height vs Weight  
- Implementing Linear Regression  
- Performing statistical tests:
  - One-sample t-test  
  - Independent two-sample t-test  
  - Paired t-test  
  - F-test for variance comparison  
  - Z-test for population mean  

The project demonstrates how height influences weight and evaluates the statistical significance of various comparisons.

## 📈 Outputs Generated

The notebook produces:

- Scatter plot of Height vs Weight  
- Linear regression line  
- Model accuracy (R² score)  
- Statistical test results including:
  - t-statistic & p-value  
  - Z-statistic & p-value  
  - F-statistic with degrees of freedom  

These outputs help interpret correlations, significance levels, and predictive accuracy.
